## Formatting

**Bold text** with double asterisks or **double underscores**, or if you're just _really_ particular, emphasize it with single asterisk or underscore.

Lists use a dash:

- Like so
- Just a normal dash

Or using asterisks:

- Star list
- Also known as, bulletpoint list

Prefer one or the other.
